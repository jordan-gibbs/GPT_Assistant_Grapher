# GPT Assistant Graph Maker

## Overview
Convert CSV files to graphs using OpenAI's GPT assistants. This tool allows you to request graphs through simple language commands, which are then generated and modified by the system.

## How It Works
- The system creates an assistant in the cloud, attaching your CSV file.
- The assistant analyzes the data and prompts you for graph specifications.
- Input your requirements in plain language.
- The assistant generates and executes code locally to produce a PNG graph.

## Prerequisites
- Python and your preferred IDE.
- OpenAI GPT Assistant API access.
- A CSV file for analysis.

## Usage
1. Place your CSV file in the 'DATA' directory.
2. Run the script and interact with the assistant in your terminal.
3. Input your graph requirements and receive a 'graph.png' file.
